# LeetCode 

This repository contains my solutions to various problems on LeetCode. Each problem is organized into its own directory, named after the problem's title.

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind creating this repository is to track my progress in solving LeetCode problems and to document my thought process and solutions. By maintaining a collection of solved problems, I can revisit them later, analyze my approach, and improve my problem-solving skills.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- Each problem has its own directory named after the problem's title .
- Within each problem directory, you will find:
  - The problem description in a README file.
  - My solution(s) to the problem in the form of source code files.
  - An explanation of the approach taken.
  - The time and space complexities of the approaches taken.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the repository and use the solutions as a reference or learning tool. Here's how you can navigate the repository:

1. Browse through the directories to find a specific problem you're interested in.
2. Open the problem's README file to read the problem description and understand the requirements.
3. Examine the provided solutions in the corresponding source code file.
4. Run the code in your preferred programming environment or LeetCode's platform to see the solution in action.
5. Experiment with the code, modify it, or use it as a starting point for your own solutions.

Please note that while these solutions have passed the tests on LeetCode and are possibly similar to preexisting solutions. There can be multiple approaches to solving each problem, so feel free to explore alternative solutions.

## Contributions

If you have suggestions, improvements, or alternative solutions you'd like to share, you can reach out to me directly at ammar_amjad@ymail.com.

## Disclaimer

Please keep in mind that these solutions are meant to serve as a reference and learning resource. It is essential to understand the problem-solving techniques and algorithms behind each solution rather than simply copying and pasting the code to make the most out of your learning experience.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my gratitude to the LeetCode platform and the community for providing a vast collection of programming problems. Solving these problems has been a valuable learning experience, and I hope my solutions can be of help to others in their coding journey..

Happy coding!
